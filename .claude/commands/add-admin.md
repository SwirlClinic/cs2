Add a new admin to the CS2 server.

## Instructions

The user will provide a SteamID64 (or multiple). Add them to:
`data/cs2/game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/admins.json`

Give them `@css/root` flags. Use unique keys like "Admin", "Admin2", etc. (check existing entries to avoid duplicates).

After adding, ask if the user wants to restart the server.
